# Elevator-Simulation---Ds-project

An elevator is a type of vertical transportation device that moves people or goods within
floors of a building.
Our project deals with the simulation of an elevator. Firstly, our program will display the
present floor where the elevator is stationed. Then, when someone want to access the
elevator, they need to choose if they want to go to the top floors or bottom floors with respect
to their current floor position. It will also display the message “Overload” when the number
of people exceeds the maximum capacity of the elevator.
Our project will display the floor numbers and the user can choose accordingly. The elevator
moves based on the preference order. So, it basically follows the principle ‘’First In First
Out’’. Our project deals with the use of circular queues. Two pointers front and rear are
declared and the elevator moves up and down accordingly.
As the elevator moves from floor to floor, it displays the current floor number reached.
When the elevator arrives at floor chosen, the message “Floor reached” is displayed and that
particular floor becomes the current lift position. This is our approach to create a basic
simulation of an elevator.
